        A claim must be fully processed, and payments are held until all pending
        issues are resolved. <strong
          >While issues are pending or during appeals, you must request payment
          each week to avoid your claim closing.</strong
        > The amount of time claims take to process varies and may take up to 5 to
        7 weeks from the file date.
